## About Laravel Mysql Docker Boilerplate

This is a docker laravel 10.8, php 8.1, mysql, nginx starter boilerplate.

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

##

This project idea I got it from upwork and I think I can showcase the best I can write with regards
to Laravel, Docker, VueJS, Livewire and Mysql. [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/jobs/span-class-highlight-Laravel-span-Vue-develop_~01611ede93cecd742b/)


## CLIENT PROJECT DESCRIPTION

This application is handling our client subscription and product information and media management.
The idea is that we would need to create a web application that will allow us to support our users and store their private data in our servers.

    - There should be a possibility that users should be able to register.
    - Apply for an account.
    - Get approved by an administrator(s).
    - Choose a subscription plan, and pay for it. 
    
After payment they should get

    - Permission to create their store account.
    - Permission to insert/upload their products to our system according to the subscription plan.

After uploading their products to our system 

    - Administrators will check and approve/reject uploaded data.

If it is approved all that client uploaded data with image paths, etc â€¦  should be ingested to our 

    - After approval send data to external Robot API endpoint. [Just use a fake endpoint]

Manager. (Partly done)

    - The application should have also Administration for managers with following features
    - User management, which includes user create/ edit/ delete/ suspend
    - User registration status review: It means we can accept users or decline them.

Super Admin (Partly done)

    - Super admin should have all functions as Administrator manager plus should be able to do following specific functions.
    - Manage Administrators, reset password,  add/delete/edit new manager info and status.

Subscription plans (MUST BE DONE using strip)
